# Windows Kernel-Mode Safe String Library


One of the major problems in software security is related to the vulnerability of working with strings. To provide greater security, Windows provides a safe string library.

Safe string library routines are prefixed with the letters "**Rtl**"; for a list of all safe string library routines for the kernel, see [Safe String Library Routines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/_kernel/#run-time-library-rtl-routines).

For more information about using safe strings, see [Using Safe String Functions](using-safe-string-functions.md).

Note that there is also a separate run-time library for general C programming in the kernel that has string functionality as well. For more information about the run-time library (RTL), see [Windows Kernel-Mode Run-Time Library](windows-kernel-mode-run-time-library.md). Note that even though both libraries are prefixed with "**Rtl**" they are not the same library.
