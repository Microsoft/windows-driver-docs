# Managing hardware submissions in the Windows Hardware Dev Center dashboard


After you submit your product for the Windows Hardware Compatibility Program for Windows 10 (or the certification program for previous Windows versions), you can manage it through the dashboard.

## Find a hardware submission

1.  Sign in to the Windows Hardware Dev Center dashboard.

2.  On the **Manage submissions** page, you can see all hardware submissions that have been submitted by your organization. To find a specific hardware submission, you can do the following:

    <table>
    <colgroup>
    <col width="50%" />
    <col width="50%" />
    </colgroup>
    <thead>
    <tr class="header">
    <th>To</th>
    <th>You can</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td><p>Search</p></td>
    <td><p>Select to search by ID or by name, and then enter the ID or name in the Search box.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td><p>Sort</p></td>
    <td><p>Click a column heading to sort the list by that property.</p></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>

3.  Click the submission ID to open more information about the submission. The following information is available:

    <table>
    <colgroup>
    <col width="50%" />
    <col width="50%" />
    </colgroup>
    <thead>
    <tr class="header">
    <th>Tab</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td><p>Submission info</p></td>
    <td><p>Describes the product, including:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p>Name</p></li>
    <li><p>Certification selection</p></li>
    <li><p>Device type</p></li>
    <li><p>The device metadata category and the default icon if you do not choose to submit a custom icon</p></li>
    <li><p>Announcement date</p></li>
    <li><p>Marketing names. You can add new marketing names and select <strong>Add</strong>.</p></li>
    <li><p>If applicable, the signed driver files can be downloaded.</p></li>
    </ul></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>

     

## Update an HCK hardware submission using the Driver Update Acceptable (DUA) process

See [Create a driver only update package](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/test/hlk/user/create-a-driver-only-update-package).

## Registering an ExtensionId

When you submit an extension INF to be signed, the dashboard attempts to associate the **ExtensionId** with your account. If the **ExtensionId** is already registered with a different account, you'll see a message prompting you to use a different ID.

For more information about specifying **ExtensionId**, see [Using an extension INF file](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/using-an-extension-inf-file). 

Note that in your submissions, you may only use ExtensionIDs that are registered to your account.
