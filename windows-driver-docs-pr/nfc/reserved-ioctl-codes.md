# Reserved IOCTL codes


All the following IOCTL codes are reserved, unless explicitly defined above; the driver MUST return STATUS\_INVALID\_DEVICE\_STATE from any of the following:

CTL\_CODE(FILE\_DEVICE\_NFP, 0x0000, \*, \*) through CTL\_CODE(FILE\_DEVICE\_NFP, 0x00FF, \*, \*)

The following IOCTLs MAY be used for IHV-specific functionality:

CTL\_CODE(FILE\_DEVICE\_NFP, 0x0100, \*, \*) through CTL\_CODE(FILE\_DEVICE\_NFP, 0x01FF, \*, \*)
